# Typescript ESM

- `commonjs` output
- Notice that I can omit extension `js` when importing.
- This branch can run successfully because there is no external package that only supports ESM. (see other branchs)

## Usage

- `pnpm install`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start` (Success)
